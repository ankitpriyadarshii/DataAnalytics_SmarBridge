Working with MetaData and Data Blending
---------------------------------------


Metadata: Information/data about data
Data blending: Mixing/joining of Data sources

Connecting to data source:
-To tableau server
-To a file
-To a server
-Saved data source


Tableau Data Types:
-Number - Decimal, Whole
-Date and time
-Date
-String
-Geographic role
Can be changed depending on the use.


Cubes and PDFs:
-When data is grouped or combined in multidimensonal matrices called Data Cubes.
-Bad idea to connect to a pdf


Management of Metadata and Extracts:
-Hide and unhide fields
-Renaming a field (name won't change on data source, only in Data pane)
-Creating and removing hierarchies fields (help in executing dril through capabilities)
-Creating Folders (to make navigation easier)
-Calculated field
