Working with Filters (contd.)
----------------------------


-Extract filter: applied at data source level. When we upload the data

-Data source filter: used to filter in the data source proportion. No .hyper file will be saved in the local system unlike Extract filter.

-Context filter: Normal filters are independent of each other, but we might need multiple filters and want the second filter to process only the records returned by first filter. Dependent filter.
Context filter improves performance and creates a dependent numerical or top N filter.

-Dimension filter: Non-aggreagated filter. 

-Measure filter: allow to perform various operations like sum, avg, medain, etc.
Aggreagted filters are always applied after Non-aggregated filters.
